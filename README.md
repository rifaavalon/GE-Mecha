A simple bash script to automate Github Enterprise in AWS! 

First and foremost, this script is very much a work in progress! 

Yes it is super simple to install Github Enterprise, but this will allow you to setup a cloudformation script for just the backup instance, then use the User-Data to pull this from an S3 bucket to create the Primary Github Enterprise instance.
